        <h1>Motivation & Drive</h1>
        <p> The drive comes from three wills: the will to create, the will to learn new things and the will to influence. By influence I mean to influence the world so that it becomes a little, a little better. This applies from students who do not have the strength to read the heavy texts on wikipedia, to everyone who has ever thought "Shit how hard it is to switch between speakers and headphones. It's like seven clicks in windows, I wish it went with one click! ". Everything that makes others a little, a little happier makes me happy. </p>

    <p>
    This is me. I am developer since early childhood. I would love to get to know you and get to know your situation and how I can help you.
    </p>
    <p>
    If you hire me you are not getting a website like Shopify or Wix. Your website will be thoughtfully developed with you as a customer and something that is truly unique and fit your needs.
